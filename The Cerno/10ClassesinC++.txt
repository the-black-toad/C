OOP
style that you can adopt to write your code 
java is meant for that
c++ does not need to be in oop, c does not have objects or classes

Classes are a way to group data or functionality together 

Class player 
{
  variables for each item
};

Player player; class acts as a type now variables made like this are called objects and the 
specific one is an instance. 

void Move(Player& needs to be a reference bc we are going to modify it. int xa, intya)
{

}

can put functions inside of classes
Functions inside classes are called methods
