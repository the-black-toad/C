Pure virtual function 
same as abstract method or interface

define in function in a base class and then force subclasses to implement them 
regular virtual functions are optional to overwrite 
interface 
- class that only consists of unimplemented methods 
- up to the sublcass to implement
- cant instantiate it 

public: 
  virtual std::string getName() = 0;
  
can only create the class if all pure virtual functions are implemented
