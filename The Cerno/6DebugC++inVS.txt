Breakpoints and reading memory are two big parts of debugging 

What are breakpoints?
pausing points in the program and when the execution hits that line it will pause
state - memory 

F9 in visiual studio or click on the line 
set breakpoints on lines that execute

step into - will take you into the function 
step over - next line of code past the function
step out - jump out of the function 

yellow arrow is not whats executed - but what it about to happen

Autos and locals - local variables 
watch - monitor variable 

memory view - debug windows memory view one
uninit stack memory will be filled with cc 

4 bytes of memory 
to jump out of a for loop, just put a breakpoint outside and run the program again
