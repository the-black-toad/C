When it is inside of a class:
  
  with a variable - one version of the variable 
    point to the same x and y 
      Entity::x=6
      Entity::y=5
      best way to reference them 
      organizational reason really 
    
  with a methods - cant reference class instances and vice versa 
   static methods do not have a class instance so you cannot refrence the class variables
   the same as writing a method outside of the class
