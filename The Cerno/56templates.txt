In java and c# they are called generics

templates are like macros, you can do anything

get the compiler to write code for you based on rules
kind of like a blueprint

if you want a print function to work with three types normally,
you would need three overload functions

or

template<typename T>
void Print(T value)
{
	std::cout << value << std::endl;
}


int main()
{

	Print<int>(5); //don't need to specify bc c++ knows 5 is int

}

print function does not exist until the template is called
