Memory allocation
stack vs heap 
stack objects have an automatic lifespan. When the var goes out of scope
it pops

heaps allocation will sit there until you free it 
takes longer!! 
have to manually free it 
java and c# are managed languages and drop everything on the heap 
for big objects

stack is faster and smaller
