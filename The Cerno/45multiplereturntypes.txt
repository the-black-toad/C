Multiple Return values

need to return two strings
can't really return two types
can return a vector

Create a struct - cherno

1. As input vars: can take in two variables and then set them inside of the function
- one of the most optimal ways to deal with this
2. As an array: pipe in the info you want and return an array. Causes a heap allocation
- specify the size of the array
- or vector
3. tuple an class that can contain multiple types
- utility and functional
- package as a tuple and return
- have to  use std::get<0>(sources)
4. create a struct
- specifiy the vars inside
- return the struct in the function
- all created on the stack
