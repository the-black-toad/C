Variables 
(the primitive types)

Store and manipulate data 

Stack and the heap is where the data is stored 

Different types of variables in C++ but don't have to follow the rules 
Real distinction is the size 

int - integers traditionally 4 bytes large. -2b to +2b because it is a signed variable. 32 bits
you can add unsigned to the front to get more space 

Sizes:
char - 1 byte 
short - 2 bytes
int - 4 bytes
long - 4 bytes
long long - 8 bytes

std::out will treat variables as they are named on the way out 

float and doubles
float - decimal value, 4 bytes, have to add an f 
double - decimale, 8 bytes 

boolean - 1 byte. Cant address bits, can access bytes 

sizeof() will tell you the byte size 

pointers and references will be addressed later
