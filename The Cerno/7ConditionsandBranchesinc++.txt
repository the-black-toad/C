Jumping around in Memory 

Branching has overhead so if you want to go super fast, you need to get rid of branching

Conditions key off of comparasions 
== checking the 4 bytes of memory to see if they are equivalent 

Can go to the dissassebly in debug to see the assembly code 
then you can walk through and see the values getting loaded 

if the if statement is one line, you do not need brackets

else if statements only get run if the first check fails
