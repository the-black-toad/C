For loops and While loops
When we want to preform the same operation multiple times 

  for(variable declaration; condition; code that is called before the next iteration)
    {
    code
    }
    
  They are very flexible and you can break out the different variable actions to be in the loop or before it
  
  While loop 
  
  Just a condition 
  
  While(condition)
    {
    code
    }

When should you use a for or while loop? Comes down to if you need a variable. Style and convention really. 
If you have a variable before and you just want to check it - while 
if you want to be more specific - for 

do while loops
Do 
{ 
code will get executed ATLEAST once 
} while (condition);
