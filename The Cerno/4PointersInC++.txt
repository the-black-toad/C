POINTERS

raw pointers 
Memory is the most important thing in programming 
Pointers manage and manipulate memory 

Pointer is an int that stores a memory address

void* ptr = 0 (not valid but that is fine NULL)
void* is a typless pointer
types mean that the data at the pointer is presumed to be that type

int var = 8;
void* ptr = &var;
store the memory address of var in ptr

*ptr = 10; - dereferencing the data so you can read or write to the data
types come in handy here to tell it how to write to that data
so would need to change from void to int 

We have been doing this on the stack

This is how you do it on the heap 

char* buffer = new char[8]
returns a pointer to the beginning of the memory address
memset(buffer, 0, 8); sets all data to 0
delete [] buffer;

char** ptr to a pointer
char** ptr = &buffer;
