Virtual functions 

If we have two classes A the prime and B the sub, if there is a function in A
We can mark it as virtual and then overwrite it in the B class

when class a is passed to a funciton and then inside that function a class function is called, it will call the parent class function

vtable - mapping of virtual functions from base class 
if you want to overwrite a function, mark it as virtual in the base class
mark with override
some additional memory is used to store the vtable 
everytime we call it has to go through that vtable so
2 preformance costs
