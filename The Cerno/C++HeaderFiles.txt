Header files 

used to declare certain types of functions to be used multiple times 
a place to say that this file exists 
not the definition of the function 

function declaration
void Log(cont char* message);

but what if you need to do this in multiple files 
header files are usually included in .cpp files 

Log.h 
#pragma once 
void Log(cont char* message);

Now it will allow you to use log anywhere with
#include "Log.h"

What is #pragma once 
# are preprocessor commands 
pragma is an instruction to only include a .cpp file once 
useful to stop duplication of variables 

Ifndef are the traditional way to guard agaisnt double definition

#ifndef _LOG_H
#define _LOG_H

struct player {};

#endif

<> to tell compiler to search specific file paths in include file paths
# is relative instructions 

cpp standard libaries have .h regular c do not
