What is a constructors 
special type of method that runs everytime we instasiate a variable 

class Entity
{
public: 
  float X, Y;
  
  Entity ()
  {
     X = 0.0;
     Y = 0.0;
  }
}

If you dont specify it will just set it to whatever was in that memory 
Can add in parameters 

Entity () = delete; will delete the default constructor
