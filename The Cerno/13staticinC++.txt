I had notes from last night but i forgot to hit commit

static outside of a class: 
statics in c++ stop the linker from looking for the same variable in other files 
only present in that translation file 
can put extern infront of a variable to force the linker to look elsewhere

static inside of a class:
across all instances of the class this variable will exist
