A mechanism to make our code look more clean 
a promise to give to not change a variable

can break it by redefining a pointer as a deference to the const var
depends on if const is before or after pointer * changes the meaning 

const int*
int* const 
const int* const 

can also apply to functions 
read only method 

if you pass a const reference you can only call const methods 
mutable - allows const methods to modify a variable
