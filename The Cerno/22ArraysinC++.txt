Array is a collection of things 
way to represent a collection of variables 

type name[how many];
int example[5];

access it by indexing. Start with 0 
If you try access a variable outside the range you will get a memory access error 
in debug mode an error, but not in production

go well with for loops 
accesses variables via offsetting the memory 
an array is a pointer 

can create on the heap as well 
int* another = new int[5];

want to create on the stack if you can because otherwise you will get preformance hit

no way to check the size of an array
