Functions

blocks that designed to do a specific function
Later when used with classes, they will be called methods

useful for stopping code duplication and maintainence 

Normally, have an input and an output
void means don't return anything 

Dont need a function for every line 

You do need to jump around in memory to execute different functions
It will take time 

Common task multiple time is ripe for a function 

main function will automatically return 0
