optimizing how vertexs are created
whern you construct it, it gets constructed on the stack in main 
need to get from main to the vector - so its copied 
- vertices.emplace_back()
- tells the constructor to create an object with the values that gets pushed back 

it constantly is getting resized as well 
- if you know your environment you should be able to preload memory
- vertices.reserve(3)
