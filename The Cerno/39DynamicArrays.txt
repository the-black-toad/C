Standard template library 
containers 

vector - shouldn't be called vector, a dynamic array 
unlike an array, it can resize 
can init with a size but most of the time no 
creates a new array, deletes the old one 
allocates a lot, so not the most efficient 


std::vector<Vertex> vertices;
can pass in primitive types
slighty more efficient to store objects
memory is in a line contigous 

vertices.push_back();

for (Vertex& v : vertices)
 std::cout << v << std::engl;
 

Make sure to pass by reference
