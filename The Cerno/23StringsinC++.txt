A string is a group of characters 
text

Characters 
characters are one byte in c++
8 bits 256 possibilities 
utf 16 around 65k 

strings use chars 
a string is basically an array of characters 
const char* name = "name";
not heap allocated 
strings are immutable
if you dont use new you dont need to use delete 

null termination char is 00 and is at the end of the string
can create an array and as long as you put the termination 00 it will print correctly 
double qoutes by default creates a char pointer 

std::string - #include <string>
a bunch of built in functions 

cant append with + to simple strings or char arrays 
need to initiate it first then you can append

passing a class into a function creates a copy of that class and gives it to the funciton
pass by constr reference const string& 
much faster
