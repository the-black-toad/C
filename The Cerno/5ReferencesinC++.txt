References are extension of pointers 

A way to reference an existing variable 
cannot be set to null, have to reference

Dont really occupy memory or storage 

int a = 5;
int& ref = a; 
ref = 2; 

creating an alias, not really a variable 
2 will come out 

important for passing variables into functions 


Annoying way to do it 
void Increment(int* value)
{
   (*value)++; need to deference first to write to the memory address 
}

Increment(&a);

////

void Increment(int& value)
{
   value++; no need to deference because we are passing in the reference 
}

Increment(a);

References are immutable 
References are just syntax sugar
